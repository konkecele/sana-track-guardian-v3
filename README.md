# SanaTrack - Blockchain Child Safety Tracking Platform

## Project Overview

SanaGuard is a decentralized child safety tracking platform built for the BlockDAG Hackathon. It combines blockchain technology with real-time location tracking to provide parents with secure, transparent, and immutable child safety monitoring.


**Frontend:**
- ✅ Built with React.js (v18.3.1) using Vite
- ✅ TailwindCSS for responsive UI design
- ✅ TypeScript for type safety
- ✅ shadcn/ui component library

**Smart Contracts:**
- ✅ Written in Solidity (EVM-compatible)
- ✅ Deployable on BlockDAG network
- ✅ Includes child registration, location updates, and emergency alert contracts

**Blockchain Integration:**
- ✅ Uses ethers.js for smart contract interaction
- ✅ MetaMask wallet connection via custom useWallet hook
- ✅ BlockDAG network compatibility
- ✅ Web3 integration for decentralized child data storage

**Deployment:**
- ✅ Smart contracts deployable to BlockDAG-compatible EVM chains
- ✅ Frontend hosted on Vercel/Netlify/IPFS compatible
- ✅ Environment variables for production deployment

### Key Features

🔐 **Blockchain Security**: All child data stored immutably on BlockDAG network

📍 **Real-time Tracking**: Interactive Mapbox integration with light theme

🚨 **Emergency Alerts**: Instant notifications to emergency contacts

👥 **Multi-child Management**: Track multiple children from one dashboard

📱 **Mobile Responsive**: Works seamlessly on all devices

🔗 **Web3 Wallet Integration**: Connect via MetaMask for blockchain interactions

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+)
- npm or yarn
- MetaMask browser extension
- Mapbox account (for mapping features)

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Environment Setup

For production deployment, set these environment variables:

```bash
# Mapbox Configuration (Public Token - Safe to expose)
VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN=pk.eyJ1IjoieW91ci11c2VybmFtZSIsImEiOiJjbGF...

# BlockDAG Network Configuration
VITE_BLOCKCHAIN_RPC_URL=https://rpc.primordial.bdagscan.com/  
VITE_CHAIN_ID=1043 
```

**Note about Mapbox Token**: The Mapbox public token is safe to include in frontend code and environment variables. Users will NOT need to enter their token every time - it's automatically loaded from environment variables in production.

## 🔧 Architecture

### Frontend Components
- **Dashboard**: Main tracking interface with real-time child status
- **TrackingMap**: Interactive Mapbox GL JS integration with custom markers
- **EmergencyAccess**: Quick access to emergency contacts and alerts
- **WalletConnection**: MetaMask integration for blockchain interactions

### Smart Contract Structure
```solidity
/**
 * @title SanaTrack - Unified Child Safety Smart Contract
 * @dev This contract integrates four core modules into a single BlockDAG-ready deployment:
 *
 * 1. Child Registry:
 *    - Register and manage child profiles (name, age, parent address).
 *
 * 2. Location Tracker:
 *    - Store encrypted location data on-chain.
 *    - Enable parents to update child locations securely.
 *
 * 3. Emergency Alerts:
 *    - Allow parents to trigger emergency alerts linked to a child.
 *    - Broadcasts critical notifications on-chain for fast response.
 *
 * 4. Parent Access Control:
 *    - Restricts updates and alerts to the child’s registered parent.
 *    - Provides security via `onlyParent` modifier.
 *
 * This unified design simplifies deployment and ensures all core child safety features
 * are accessible from a single smart contract address.
 *
 * Hackathon Notes:
 * - Optimized for BlockDAG testnet/EVM deployment.
 * - Consolidated for easier demo, ABI management, and frontend integration.
 *
```

### Blockchain Integration
- **useWallet Hook**: Custom React hook for MetaMask connectivity
